Are you stuck in a rut to figure out what your next hit romance cover art is going to be? We have you covered \*wink wink\* ! With our website you can shuffle through some of our built in covers with the **show new random cover** button, save your favorite covers and view your **saved covers**. 

If you are itching to be more creative, you can also make your own cover! Simply input the file path of your .jpg to the cover section on the **Make Your Own Cover** form. Next add your *spicy title*, first and second descriptor. After you click the **make my book** button, click the **home** button to save your cover to view it for later.
